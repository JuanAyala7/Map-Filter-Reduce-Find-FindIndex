# Map-Filter-Reduce-Find-FindIndex

## Why is this important?

Going through mapping in greater detail and also looking at some of the related functions
that help us deal with arrays such as map, filter, reduce, find, and find index.

It shows us how it aids in cutting down the length of our functions.

## Lessons Learned

Unlike forEach where we have to create a new empty array, and then every time we do something with each item inside the array we push to the new array. Instead, with map, it just does it all by itself. This is handy in React when we're creating custom components and mapping data to it.

All of these functions are compatible across all browsers. They were also introduced way before ES6 so you can safely use this code anywhere on any browser.

## Considerations

It will be really hard to remember all of these. 

Instead, I recommend really understanding what's going on and what the goals are of each of these methods: map, filter, reduce, find and find index so that when you actually have a need for something that one of these functions might be able to help you achieve somewhere in the back of your mind you might have a light bulb go off and utilize the function to do what it is that you need it to do.
